# How to Make A Music Database

1. Find two closely related music subgenres
2. Find a list of artists for the subgenre on Wikipedia
3. Check the discography of an artist (Either on Wikipedia or discogs.com)
4. Look at the the albums starting at the earliest release
5. Find the earliest album you that matches the subgenre
6. If an album has other genres listed, that is ok so long as it isn't the same genre that you are comparing against (ie both dreampop and shoegaze)
7. If it meets these criteria, add to spotify playlist
8. Repeat until you get ~630 songs
